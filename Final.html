<h3>What's The Problem?
</h3>
<p>In the past years, the topic has arose to propose a gun ban in the United States and there are many sides to this topic, but how was it brought to the surface? This is a result of the recent increase of gun violence in the US such as the numerous school shootings in the past years. Some people believe that you can walk into a gun store and walk out with a fully automatic machine gun, but in reality there is a ten day or more waiting period after you enter the store and pick the gun you want along with the fact the fully automatic weapons are illegal in most states and sold in almost no gun stores across the country. A lot of the US population is angry at guns because of the violence they "cause", but are the guns really the problem? Since the US gained their independence in 1776, the Bill of Rights has stated that US citizens have the right to bear arms. Many say that this was because of the danger of the British or because of the more prominent threat of wild animals. We used guns to earn this country so should we really get rid of them all?
