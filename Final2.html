<h3>
  What Are The Effects?
</h3>
<p>This problem is affecting people on both sides of the problem in very different ways. Most people that want to propose a gun ban think that the guns are the problem and they claim to feel unsafe with the easy access to “assault rifles”. First off, AR does not stand for assault rifle in the common AR-15 rifle, but it actually stands for ArmaLite Rifle after the company that first manufactured it in the 1950’s. This is a common mistake that strikes fear into knowledgeable people of our society. On the other hand, people also tend to determine the threat level of the gun based on how it looks. For example, if you showed somebody an AR-15 and a Mini-14 they would most likely be fine with the Mini-14 because of the fact that it is primarily made of wood and not tactical metal material. There has also been talk of banning rifles only, but why do that when the vast majority of all shootings that have occured in the past years have been with handguns. Along with that, most of the shootings are committed by people who have some kind of mental disorder or a problem with their current mental state. If the ban goes through there will be more illegal trafficking of guns which is just another problem added to the list. The people that own guns are also affected because they believe that their rights would be infringed if the ban were to go through. There are also many people that hunt for food and most people are fine with that, but if we ban guns that won’t be an option.
