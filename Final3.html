<h3>
  Possible Solutions
</h3>
<p>There aren’t a whole lot of solutions, but most are very simple. We could start by informing people about guns and the process on how to get them to show them that you can’t just walk in and walk out with a gun. Since the problem has mostly arose from gun violence we could improve our mental institutes in the country to provide people with the help. Currently the United States has a terrible mental healthcare system and if we could improve that it could prevent almost all of the shootings in the country. The guns have never been the problem because by themselves the guns are harmless. The problem is when the gun gets into the wrong hands and that’s what we need to fix. So if we could improve our mental healthcare system we wouldn’t need to propose a ban on guns and it really is that simple so why don’t we get started.
