<p>Call of Duty Black Ops 4 is a first person shooter with 3 different game modes including multiplayer, zombies, and blackout. Multiplayer is usually teams of 6 unless it is free for all which is every man for himself. Zombies is a survival based game mode where yo kill the oncoming rounds of zombies to gain points in order to get better weapons and gain more access to the rest of whatever map you are playing on. Blackout is a battle royale mode with teams of 1 to 4 where you search the map to find weapons, healing, gadgets, etc. The main goal in blackout is to be the last team standing so it is basically hunger games. This is an amazing game all around and I recommend that anyone who loves shooters tries this game.</p>
